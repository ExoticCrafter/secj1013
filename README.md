## 💭 Reflection

### 💡 What I Gained
This course was my gateway into the world of structured programming. I developed a strong command of the **C++ programming language**, covering everything from basic data types to complex concepts like **pointers** and **file handling**.

I particularly loved learning C++ because of its **blazing fast performance** and its versatility in being **applicable to almost any hardware architecture**. Mastering C++ syntax was a rewarding challenge; its strict structure taught me code discipline and precision that high-level languages often overlook. I now feel confident using functions to modularize code and arrays/structs to manage data efficiently.

### 📈 Areas for Improvement
While I am comfortable with the basics, I realized that mastering **Pointers** and **Memory Management** requires more practice. At times, debugging logic errors in complex nested loops or file input/output streams was challenging. Moving forward, I plan to work on more competitive programming problems to sharpen my logic and deepen my understanding of how C++ handles memory under the hood.

### 📝 Final Thoughts
**Programming Technique I (SECJ1013)** has been instrumental in building my developer mindset. It wasn't just about learning a language; it was about learning how to solve problems computationally. Under the mentorship of **Dr. Muhammad Luqman**, I have laid a solid foundation that I am excited to build upon in future data engineering challenges.
